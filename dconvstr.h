 *                            On entry, this variable is initialized by caller.
 *                            On exit, this variable points to the end of printed string.
 *                           
 *  @param  outbuf_size       Size of output buffer filled by the function.
 *                            On entry, this variable is initialized by caller to maximum allowed size.
 *                            On exit, this variable contains size of unused portion of the output buffer.
 *                           
 *  @param  value             Input value (IEEE 754 floating-point double precision).
 *                           
 *  @param  format_char       Format char. Either 'e', or 'f', or 'g'. Refer to printf(3) manual for details.
 *                           
 *  @param  format_flags      Any combination of the above (DCONVSTR_FLAG_*).
 *                           
 *  @param  format_width      Format width. Used only if DCONVSTR_FLAG_HAVE_WIDTH bit is set in flags.
 *                            Refer to printf(3) manual for details.
 *
 *  @param  format_precision  Format precision. Set it to DCONVSTR_DEFAULT_PRECISION if unsure.
 *                            Refer to printf(3) manual for details.
 *
 *  @returns  1  if value was successfully converted to string.
 *            0  if there is not enough room in buffer or internal error happened during conversion.

 *  @param  output_erange  Address of overflow/underflow flag variable, filled by function.
 *                         0  if there is no overflow/underflow condition
 *                         1  if there is overflow/underflow condition: strtod(3) would set errno = ERANGE
 *
 *  @returns  1  if there were no internal errors
 *            0  if there was internal error during conversion.
 *
 *  In general, interface of this function is similar to strtod(3), except for returning overflow

 *  error checking, then set input_end != NULL and use ( ret_value != 0 )&&( **input_end == 0 )
